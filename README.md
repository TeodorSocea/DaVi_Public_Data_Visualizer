# DBpedia Explorer (WADe)

> A Web Application Development (WADe) project for exploring DBpedia entities and categories using SPARQL, with semantic annotations and extensible UI components.

---

## 🧠 About the Project

**DBpedia Explorer (WADe)** is a single-page web application that allows users to explore **DBpedia entities and categories** through a clean, interactive interface.

The application supports:

- Searching DBpedia entities and categories
- Browsing category hierarchies (broader / narrower)
- Viewing semantic metadata (RDFa + JSON-LD)
- Discovering related entities via shared categories
- Extensible UI through a custom extension system

The project is designed to align with **Web Application Development (WADe)** principles:

- Client–server architecture
- REST APIs
- Semantic Web technologies
- Modular and extensible frontend design

## 📄 Documentation

### Scholarly HTML Technical Report

The full technical report for this project (architecture, data models, semantic web usage, and user guide) is available as a Scholarly HTML document:

- 📘 [`docs/scholarly-html.html`](docs/scholarly-html.html)

This document follows the WADe requirements and includes:

- Service-oriented architecture description
- Use of DBpedia, SKOS, and OWL
- API design and data models
- User guide with case studies and visual examples

---

### OpenAPI Specification

The backend exposes a REST API documented via OpenAPI (Swagger), automatically generated by FastAPI:

- 🔗 Swagger UI:  
  `http://34.32.129.15//docs`

- 🔗 OpenAPI JSON specification:  
  `http://34.32.129.15//openapi.json`

The OpenAPI specification describes all available endpoints, input/output formats, and usage examples.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

The application is deployed using Docker and Docker Compose.

- Frontend: Single Page Application (Vite + React)
- Backend: FastAPI microservice exposing SPARQL-backed APIs
- Data source: DBpedia public SPARQL endpoint

See the Scholarly HTML report for full deployment and architectural details.

## 🚀 Built With

### Frontend

- React (Vite)
- TypeScript
- React Router
- RDFa & JSON-LD

### Backend

- FastAPI
- Python
- SPARQL (DBpedia endpoint)
- Async HTTP requests

### Deployment

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Google Cloud Compute Engine

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Search**

  - Entities, categories, or both
  - Paginated results
  - Result counts (entities vs categories)

- 🗂️ **Category Exploration**

  - Broader / narrower navigation (SKOS-style)
  - Sample entities per category
  - Type facet filtering

- 🧩 **Entity Pages**

  - Categories and RDF types
  - Related entities based on shared categories
  - Semantic annotations (RDFa + JSON-LD)

- 🧱 **Extension System**

  - Slot-based registry
  - Category sidebar extensions
  - Entity sidebar extensions

---

## 🧩 Extension Architecture

The application includes a **custom extension registry**, inspired by plugin systems.

Example:

```ts
registerExtension({
  id: "ext-type-facets",
  slot: "category.sidebar",
  render: ({ categoryId }) => <TypeFacets categoryId={categoryId} />,
});
```

### Supported slots

- `category.sidebar`
- `entity.sidebar`

This allows features such as:

- Type facets
- Category maps
- Related entities
- Future visualizations (graphs, timelines, maps)

---

## 🧪 Semantic Web Support

This project explicitly supports **Semantic Web standards**:

- SPARQL queries against DBpedia
- RDFa embedded in rendered HTML
- JSON-LD for structured metadata
- SKOS concepts for category navigation

The content is both **human-readable and machine-readable**.
